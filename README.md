Contact List Management System

This project provides a robust contact list management system implemented in C, designed to handle a large number of contacts efficiently. By utilizing a tree data structure, the system ensures fast and effective search capabilities, making it user-friendly and scalable.

Features:

Efficient Data Storage: Contacts are organized in a tree structure, which allows for quick insertion, deletion, and search operations.
Comprehensive Contact Management:
Add Contacts: Easily add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, and email.
Delete Contacts: Remove contacts from the list with straightforward commands.
Update Contacts: Modify existing contact information as needed.
Search Functionality: Quickly locate contacts through efficient tree-based search algorithms.
User-Friendly Interface: A command-line interface simplifies interaction, providing a clear and intuitive way to manage the contact list.
Data Integrity: The system includes checks to ensure that contact information is stored and retrieved accurately.
Key Technologies:

Programming Language: C
Data Structure: Tree (e.g., Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
Usage:

Compile and Run: Instructions are provided for compiling and running the program on different platforms.
Commands: Detailed documentation on available commands and their usage is included in the repository.
